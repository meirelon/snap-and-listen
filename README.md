# Snap and Listen

Snap a selfie or a landscape and let image recognition do the rest. Then Spotify will recommend you a corresponding playlist.

## Getting Started

Project front end is a Telegram chat bot and the back end is GCP cloud functions in a python37 runtime. Unfortunately, you will need your own GCP project and API keys to run this on your own.

## Prerequisites

* [Telegram chat bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) - Front end used
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) - Back end
* [Cloud Functions API Enabled](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) - Webhook
* [Cloud Vison API Enabled](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) - Image Recognition
* [Spotify Developer Application](https://developer.spotify.com/) - Spotify Search API
